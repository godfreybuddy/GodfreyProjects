## About
TextEx was a semester capstone simulation of software engineering in the field. The project itself was to create an application 
based off of stakeholder's specifications in which a user could load and store various texts and then search through all cataloged 
texts to return queried information.

I did not do much direct coding for this application because my primary role was to function as my group's project manager; 
keeping the project on track and moving forward using agile methodologies. Through the use of Vivify Scrum and Prototyping, 
I made sure my group maintained a pace that kept the stakeholders happy. Using sprints that ended every two 
weeks and stakeholder meetings at the conclusion of each sprint with a functional prototype of the product to show progress,
my team was always ahead of schedule and was able to deliver a product that exceeded stakeholder expectations.
